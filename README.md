Customer churn with PCA and logistic regression


Telecom Churn: Logistic Regression with PCA
With 21 predictor variables, we need to predict whether a particular customer
will switch to another telecom provider or not. In telecom terminology, customer attrition is referred to as 'churn'.
We have 3 data files churn data , internet data and customer data. 

I have combined  these three files to take all the 21 variables at first site.


Note that the in all the three files customerid is in same order hence we have merged it without taking any keys.


The model is built using both  Logistic regression as well as PCA.
